/**
 * Coverage invariants for the extension catalogue.
 *
 * Context, because the raw numbers mislead: 125 of 227 entries have neither
 * instructions nor CSRs, and that is mostly correct. Umbrellas and aliases
 * (K, N, P, Zve, Zvf), VLEN parameter entries (Zvl32b ... Zvl1024b) and
 * behavioural guarantees (Zkt, which promises data-independent timing and
 * defines nothing) all legitimately carry no encodings.
 *
 * So this does not assert "every extension has content", which would be false,
 * and it does not carry a 125-entry allowlist, which would be unmaintainable
 * fiction. It asserts what is actually knowable, each case having caught or
 * being able to catch a real defect:
 *
 *   1. A tag that yields nothing is a broken mapping, not an empty extension.
 *   2. An umbrella that resolves to nothing means its members went stale.
 *   3. CSR coverage is a ratchet, so a sync regression cannot pass silently.
