 * ExtensionEvolution — how RISC-V grew, and when each extension arrived.

 * Two charts over one calendar axis. The curve answers "how fast did this grow";
 * the scatter puts every dated extension on the month it was ratified, so the
 * reader sees the events themselves rather than a summary of them.
 *
 * Neither chart has a denominator. The waffle these replaced drew each family as
 * a row of filled squares, which reads as "42 of 42" when the catalogue has no
 * maximum; the lifecycle bars that followed implied continuous work across every
 * year a bar spanned, which is equally untrue. A dot is an event.
 *
 * Inline SVG and absolutely-positioned spans rather than a charting library: two
 * charts of this size do not justify a dependency, and the published page's CSP
 * admits scripts from a short allowlist only.
